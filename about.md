Hi, I'm Cayden.

I am committed to designing & building transformative, beautiful futures from the ground up. Growing up around the internet has meant that "technology," in the high-tech sense, is always on my mind. As a trans masculine person of color, "technology," broadly construed, is of paramount importance to survival. Regardless of what kind of tech we're talking about, I'm primarily interested in how technology changes the way we are social with one another.

I have been involved in building movements that care for whole people since I came out of the closet as a high school student in suburban Michigan. I have worked in various movements and organizing formations since then, from student movements focused on higher education to organized labor to trending hashtags on Twitter to neighborhood efforts against gentrification and displacement.

I have education in fine art and film/media studies, philosophy of language, and facilitation for social change. I think a lot about pedagogy and how we teach people to do things online and off, as well as grapple with difficult questions about power, identity, and inequality.

My current day job is as Executive Director of [18MillionRising.org](http://18mr.org), a digital-first movement-building organization working with Asian American & Pacific Islander communities. My previous roles at 18MR.org have included Chief Technology Officer, New Media Director, and Social Media Wizard. I'm proud to say that I'm responsible for introducing lightweight, modular tech stacks into digital-first organizing and for [VoterVOX](https://votervox.org), an experiment in how tech designed by communities can transform workflows that already exist in those communities into important tools for change.

Previous day jobs include: teaching media theory and game design to undergraduates; bartending at a vegetarian restaurant; organizing university workers for a labor union; driving a delivery route; and freelance web design.

Work that I've done that I don't get paid for includes organizing with the [Save E. 12th Coalition](http://proposal.e12thoakland.org), which brought neighbors together to design and propose a plan for a parcel of public land in my current neighborhood in Oakland, California; cofounding [Youngist](http://youngist.org), a youth media collective that we closed in 2016 that published fearless reporting and commentary from youth movements around the world; working with the movement tech community on issues of equity and gender-based violence in our work and organizing spaces; helping organize the [Allied Media Conference](https://alliedmedia.org/amc); and writing about all the ideas you will find on this website.

I am working on a book manuscript about the relationship between affect, capital, and organizing on social media. I also give thoughtful [advice](/ans/) about work, love, and being a decent human in a screwed up world.
