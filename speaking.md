## Book Me

Want to invite me to speak at your event or conference?

I can talk about current [work](/cv/), technology and organizing, and give workshops on some of the best practices around technology and social media strategy 18MR has developed over the past several years. I am happy to negotiate on honoraria, especially with student groups and grassroots organizers.

Get the process started by introducing yourself: who you are, where your event is, and why you're interested in hosting me.
